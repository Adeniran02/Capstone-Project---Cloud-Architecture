# Capstone Course Project--Cloud-Architecture
The idea behind this project was to gauge the knowledge gained during the course work  and use this as a bedrock to build a sustainable cloud architecture for a company following careful research on the business needs and required outcomes.

In this article, I wrote about the entire process of designing a robust cloud architecture for **JustGo**, a global ride-hailing company that is transitioning from on-premises to the cloud. The goal is to enhance the company's current data strategy to accommodate scalability, optimization, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Data is every firm's most crucial asset for tackling business challenges, enhancing customer satisfaction, developing advanced models to predict future outcomes, and bolstering their marketing strategies. This process involves collaborating with various customer groups to determine the type of data we need to collect, how to collect and store it and the processes the data will undergo.
